# Feature Files

Cycle testing scripts are stored in source files (called Feature Files) with a “.feature” extension. Every Feature File starts with a description to provide an overview of the Scenarios in a given source file. This description begins with the keyword “Feature:”.

Feature Files are the highest level grouping of test Scenarios and are used to group Scenarios that relate together. See *Figure 1B*.

Feature Files have a single “Feature” defined in them, but can have as many Scenarios as is applicable. Cycle has syntax highlighting to help users draw distinctions between Cycle keywords and other important parts of the Feature File.

Examples of Cycle’s currently defined keywords are: **Feature, Background, Scenario, Scenario Outline, Examples, Given, And, When, Then, If, EndIf, Else, ElsIf, While, and EndWhile.**
