Cycle User Manual
=======

Cycle is an easy-to-use testing tool designed to facilitate reliable automated testing at any phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). By emulating normal user interactions such as keyboard or mouse input, Cycle can be used to create and execute reliable and repeatable automated software tests. 
Cycle test scripts (called Feature Files) are written in business readable language, which can be easily understood and written by non-technical personnel. Cycle is intended for Regression Testing, Implementation Testing, and Unit Testing. However, in addition to SDLC testing, Cycle Feature Files can be utilized for user training, SOPs or Detailed Work Instructions and other required validations or certifications such as SOX, JCC, or FDA.
